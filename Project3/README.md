## Project Description:
(This assignment was to test our ability to add, push, and commit to a local repository our own individual work)

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (Version control systems can be either local or remote and allow for shared collaboration)
2. (Distributed Version control systems allow for the same as a VCS except since everything is housed locally allows for offline work while still maintaining collaboration)
3. (The use of a VCS allows for you to rollback any mistakes you might make and even allows you to see the history of changes done to the code)
