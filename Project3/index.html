        <!-- First Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic1">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="https://www.visualstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/TFS_VersionControl_636x350-op.png">

                <span class="text-muted"></span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I found version control interesting as the idea of coding in a group environment never really had crossed my mind as I always figured that all projects were for the most part handled by one person on one specific idea.Now when looking at the idea, version control makes a lot of sense since it allows for such easy sharing between groups of people and allows for a much less stressful environment. I believe this to be incredibly important for the course as a whole as we begin to understand how to work together in order to build proper code.</p>

        <!-- Second Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic2">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-left" src="https://betterexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/version_control/distributed/distributed_example.png">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Distributed
                <span class="text-muted">Version control</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I found distributed version control to be incredibly interesting as it allows for the same level of cooperation as a standard version control system, however it also comes with the benefit of allowing the user to work offline as everything is local, therefore it also runs faster. This can prove to be vital knowledge for this class as we should understand that you will have to work in different environments and as such knowing that you have the capability to work offline and locally while still maintain a shared repository is incredible.</p>

        <!-- Third Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic3">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/52/2f/28/522f28bf38b1c26c9221fc887e46a76a--create-infographics-webdesign.jpg">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Git
                <span class="text-muted">History Tracking</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">I found the fact that Git allows for users to not only see what changes they have done to their code in the past, but to also see what other people who are collaborating with you have done to change the code as an incredibly vital tool. I feel as though this also proves to be incredibly important for what we learn as we should understand that sometimes mistakes happen and that we have the capability through version control systems to see what these mistakes might have been and easily fix them.</p>

       <!-- Fourth Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic4">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-left" src="http://blog.tomgurion.me/images/git_staging_commit.png">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Add, Commit, Push
                <span class="text-muted"</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Add, Commit, and push are interesting in that they are a vital part of gits distributed version control system and I believe that having a system such as this makes sense since it allows for the user to really ensure that what they are doing with their code is done properly and makes it towards a remote repository without failure. These commands are vital for this course as we will be working with git and should properly understand how to add files to a remote repository with success.</p>

        <!-- Fifth Featurette -->
        <div class="featurette" id="topic5">
            <img class="featurette-image img-circle img-responsive pull-right" src="https://www.yourlocalcomputerguy.co.uk/img/500one.jpg">
            <h2 class="featurette-heading">VCS
                <span class="text-muted">Backup local files</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">While most of the ideas of VCS relate to remote sharing and collaboration. VCS can also prove vital to the lone coder! The fact that VCS backup local files so in the case that if anything were to go wrong you would still have all your work is incredible even for a coder who is working on something alone. I believe this is important to note for our class as we wont always be working in a group setting, and having the ability to save our code not only on our local machine but also on a VCS can be incredibly helpful.</p>
